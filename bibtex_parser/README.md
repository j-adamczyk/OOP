# BibTeX parser
This is the first Java application I've created, for my Object-Oriented Programming course. 
It's a BibTeX file parser, which loads provided BibTeX file (minimally simplified) and parses it's contents. 
It was meant mostly for educational purposes, so it may contain typical newbie imperfections, e. g. we were required to use many 
design patterns, so some of the existing ones may not be required for real-life applications.
