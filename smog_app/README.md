# Smog information retrieval
This app is my second Java project, created for Object-Oriented Programming course. 
It's a console application which retrieves smog (air pollution) information from Polish GIOÅš (government environtment office) and 
calculates selected statistics. It uses REST API requests and parses them with Google GSON parser. 
It was meant as an educational project (e. g. may contain design patterns for the sole purpose of learning how to implement them) 
and should not be used in real production.
